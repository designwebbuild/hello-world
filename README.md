GitHub practise guide..
My name is Krešimir Marić. I come from Croatia and currently living in Dublin Ireland where I work as a professional chef. I have high interest in internet and technology. That’s why my mission is to change career and work my way in to the world of IT. I am currently a student at OpenClassrooms attending a front-end web developer path.
